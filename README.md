# SE407|| Midterm

The objective of this midterm is to cumulatively demonstrate what you have learned in the course thus far. You will be expected to create a .NET Class Library that Scaffolds the database SE407_Bookstore. This Database had 5 tables (Transactions, Books, Authors, Genres, Customers) and has the same structure and relationships as the SE407_BlockBuster database. The functions I am looking for are to search for a single book by title, search for all the books in the bookstore, search for all the books by Author last name.

You will also create an Xunit Test Project that will have functions that test the previously mentioned functions. Lastly you will need to create a console applications that takes in command line arguments to allow you to choose which functions you are choosing and you should be able to choose if the output of the information will be a CSV document or written to the console.
